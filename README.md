# Based CLISP

Based CLISP is a fork of GNU Clisp. It is kept in sync with the official clisp repo.

It's main purpose is to remove the menorah from the homescreen.

That way palestinian programmers can code lisp all they want without being reminded about their oppressors. 

## building clisp

cd src

./configure

that will build the make file and tell you what to do next
