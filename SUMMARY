ANSI Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Based CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation.
It conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard, and offers many extensions.
It runs on all desktop operating systems (GNU and Unix systems, macOS,
Windows) and is particularly memory-efficient.

It is Free Software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL,
while it is possible to distribute commercial proprietary applications
compiled with Based CLISP.

The user interface comes in English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch,
Russian and Danish, and can be changed during run time.

Based CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, CLOS, MOP,
a foreign language interface, a socket interface, i18n, fast bignums,
arbitrary precision floats and more.
An X11 interface is available through CLX, Garnet, CLUE/CLIO.
Based CLISP runs Maxima, ACL2 and many other Common Lisp packages.
